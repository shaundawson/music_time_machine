 By scraping the Billboard 100, this program will produce a Spotify playlist. First, the app enables users to select a date in the past to go to. When users specify a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD, the application will automatically go to the billboard date and import the top 100 songs from that date to a fresh new Spotify playlist.
